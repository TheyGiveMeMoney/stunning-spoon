This is an updated repository for the [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffJ38dBzrlY) by Antonio

Please use this as a guideline for parts you may be stuck on

You will need to install the STRIPE cli

as well as prisma studio

and follow the instructions from the video properly for this repo to work

Including adding your .env with the proper information and api keys / secrets

again use this as a guideline for parts you may be stuck on 

Changes have been made from the tutorial so be diligent of the changes, and be sure to play around and see what the changes do or how they can affect the results of the code-


I will post each section of the tutorial (adding, video gen, pic gen, music gen, etc.) if I get a chance to clean the code up a little and will do so to this repo - - 

Please leave a comment or contact me directly if need be or if this helped you in any way!

Happy coding!
